Hello World! 

My name is Andrew Nally and I am a recent graduate from The Tech Academy Coding Bootcamp. There, I took two bootcamps, the Front End Developer bootcamp, 
as well as the FullStack Software Engineer Bootcamp. With over 1300 hours of coursework at The Tech Academy, I have been trained, with experience, in several programming 
languages and their frameworks, database management softwares, runtime environments, as well as various DevOps and Project management softwares and methodologies. 

Nearly 3 years ago I wrote my first line of code, and after countless nights of learning how to communicate with computers, I believe I've received a well rounded,
in depth education and understanding of some of the key fundamental technologies and practices in developing software. At the very least, enough knowledge and expertise 
to be considered an asset to any future development team joined. 

As I continue to stay up to date with the technological trends of the industry, I look forward to pursuing an entry level tech position. A position, where all of my skills learned through hard work
can be utilized effectively and with purpose, throughout the duration of my career, for years to come.
